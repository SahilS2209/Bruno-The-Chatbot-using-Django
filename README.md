This is a chatbot made in Django.

I have used OpenAi api key to integrate it with ChatGPT.

It has the same function as ChatGPT.

The user can ask any task to it and it will give the specific response.

You can try these prompts:
"what is the weather today"
"write a program to add two numbers in java"
"Who is the Prime Minister of India"
